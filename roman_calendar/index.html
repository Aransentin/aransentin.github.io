<h1>Falsehoods Time Travellers Believe about <span class=red>Roman Time</span></h1>

<p>So you bought your very own flux capacitor &mdash; congratulations! However, before you strap it onto your car to go and prevent the assassination of Tiberius Gracchus, you need to know a bit about the Roman calendar. You don't want to embarrass yourself by asking something silly like “Is this 133 BC?” when you arrive, now would you?</p>
<p>Here, I collect a few pitfalls you might run into when using the Republican calendar, i.e. the one in use before Julius Caesar reformed it in 45BC.</p>

<h2>The Romans years are counted from the founding of Rome</h2>

<p>You might have read somewhere that the Romans counted years from <em>AUC</em> &mdash; <em>Ab Urbe Condita</em>, “from the founding of the city”. Sadly it's not going to be that easy. By far, the common method of specifying what year you were talking about was to mention what consuls were serving during that time. So, for example, you'd have to say something like <em>“During the consulship of L. Licinius Crassus and Q. Mucius Scaevola”</em> to refer to 95 BC.</p>

<p>A consular term lasted for one year and you'd use the names of the consuls elected first &mdash; if a consul died and was replaced in the middle of the year, the name of the new consul was not used for dating.</p>

<h2>The Roman year starts at January 1</h2>

<p>Nope! The year didn't necessarily start on January 1, but started when the consul was inaugurated. From 153 BC and forward it was Jan 1 (which is why is why our modern calendar starts there, too) but before that March 15 and before 222 BC May 1, but with many exceptions due to wartime crises or political shenanigans. The consuls led the armies, and since replacing a consul in the field was a poor strategic decision the Romans instead sometimes elected to move the entire year forwards or backwards as the situation required, as in the case of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Fulvius_Nobilior'>Quintus Fulvius Nobilior</a>.</p>

<h2>A Roman year always has a name</h2>

<p>In 77 BC, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aemilius_Lepidus_(consul_78_BC)'>Marcus Aemilius Lepidus</a> rebelled. This caused the senate to declare a state of emergency, resulting in a delayed consular election and the year not having a name until later that year.

<h2>The Roman January 1 is the same as the Gregorian January 1</h2>

<p>If you use your time machine on April 12 and go back 2100 years, you're very likely not going to wind up on the Roman April 12; the names might be the same, but the months are not. The Roman calendar had 355 days, so it would quickly drift out of alignment with the solar year just like the Islamic one. To fix that, the Romans used a leap month &mdash; <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedonius'>Mercedonius</a>.</p>
<p>Mercedonius was inserted arbitrarily when the Pontifex Maximus felt that the year was too out of alignment with the seasons, and to make matters worse the length of the month wasn't fixed. In theory they'd insert it every second or third year and make it 27 or 28 days long, but in practice it was delayed or advanced for political reasons &mdash; the Pontifex could shorten the terms for his enemies and lengthen terms for friends.</p>

<h2>The Roman Year has at most 13 unique months</h2>

<p>No. In the year <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_calendar#Julian_reform'>46 BC</a> two extra months in addition to Mercedonius was added, <em>Intercalaris Prior</em> and <em>Intercalaris Posterior</em>, making that year 15 months.</p>

<h2>The Roman Year has at least 12 unique months</h2>

<p>In the very early Roman calendar before tradition states that <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numa_Pompilius'>Numa Pompilius</a> modified it, January and February did not exist. The winter simply did not have dates at all. The names of September to December still bear traces of that today, being named after the Roman numbers seven to ten respectively.</p>

<h2>The Roman months occur one after another</h2>

<p>Mercedonius, the leap month, is inserted <em>in the middle</em> of February (yes, really) so during leap years we actually have 14 “ranges” of dates to take into account &mdash; the 11 regular months, the first part of February, Mercedonius, and the second part of February.</p>

<h2>The Roman days of the month are numbered in order</h2>

<p>Not so fast. The Romans had 3 special days in each month:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The <em>Kalends</em>, always the first day of the month.
    <li>The <em>Nones</em>, the 7th day of the longer months or the 5th day of the shorter months.
    <li>The <em>Ides</em>, the 15th or 13th day of the long and short months respectively.
</ul>

<p>So, you didn't say <em>“March 15”</em>, you said <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Julius_Caesar">“On the Ides of March”</a></em>. The day before that was <em>“The day before the Ides”</em>.
Then you <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting#Inclusive_counting'>skipped</a> the second day and went straight to <em>“The 3rd Day before the Ides”</em>, and continued from there.</p>

<p>After the Ides you counted up to the Kalends of the next month, so “The 9th Day before the Kalends of November” was actually October 24 &mdash; and it was actually the 8th day before the Kalends in our modern way of counting.</p>

<h2>Names of dates in a Roman year refer to an unique day</h2>

<p>When Mercedonius is inserted into February the names of the dates in February don't change. This meant that dates in February like “The 7th Day before the Kalends of March” is actually 2 days before the Kalends of Mercedonius, and Mercedonius has its own “7th Day before the Kalends of March” that refers to an entirely different day even though it has the exact same name. </p>

<h2>The Roman hour is 60 minutes long</h2>

<p>Luckily for us, the Romans didn't use minutes or seconds. The hours are more complicated: the day is divided into day and night, and each has 12 hours. This means that if the day is longer than the night (e.g. in the Italian summer) an hour during the day is a fair bit longer than an hour during the night.</p>

<p>This means that when we want to know the time, we'll need to take into account the observers latitude <em>and</em> longitude to calculate when the sunrise happens that day, and thus how long an hour is.</p>

<p>This mess actually causes trouble for us when we want to know what year it is, too &mdash; the Roman day starts at midnight, but midnight is in the exact middle between sundown and sunrise, and that's not always 00:00! This means that when we have a modern time of e.g. 00:03 it might still be the previous day in the Roman calendar depending on the observers latitude, and thus sometimes an entirely different year. </p>

<h2>The Romans had the same week as we do</h2>

<p>The Roman week is eight days, not seven, and they themselves referred to it as a nine-day week due to their aforementioned confusing method of counting ranges. The eight day &mdash; the “Nundinae” &mdash; is the market day, analogous to our weekend; children were exempt from school, patricians did not conduct business and public assemblies were <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Hortensia'>banned entirely</a>.</p>

<h2>The Romans weekdays always had the same name</h2>

<p>The Roman days are named after letters of the Alphabet, from <b>A</b> to <b>H</b>. This would have given the weekdays a fixed name, if it wasn't for the fact that the letter always reset to <b>A</b> on the Kalends on January and to <b>G</b> on the Kalends of Mercedonius. This means that finding out that it's e.g. day <b>C</b> today does not tell you much in isolation!</p>

<h2>The Roman week was always the same length</h2>

<p>No. At least <a href='http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/48*.html#33.4'>one week in 41 BC was nine days long,</a> and another unspecified week in the same year one day shorter. This was done so that the first day first day of the year wouldn't coincide with the market day which was considered bad luck.</p>

<h2>The Roman weekday is the same everywhere</h2>

<p>Nope. From graffiti know that the nundinae in Pompeii occurred <a href='https://www.instonebrewer.com/TyndaleSites/Egypt/ptolemies/chron/roman/ad60.htm'>four days after</a> that of the nundinae in Cumae, and the market in Rome was two days after that.</p>
